/*
2. A Daphne array is defined to be an array that contains at least one odd number and begins and ends with the same number of even numbers.
So {4, 8, 6, 3, 2, 9, 8,11, 8, 13, 12, 12, 6} is a Daphne array because it begins with three even numbers and ends with three even numbers and it contains at least one odd number
The array {2, 4, 6, 8, 6} is not a Daphne array because it does not contain an odd number.
The array {2, 8, 7, 10, -4, 6} is not a Daphne array because it begins with two even numbers but ends with three even numbers.
Write a function named isDaphne that returns 1 if its array argument is a Daphne array. Otherwise, it returns 0.
If you are writing in Java or C#, the function signature is int isDaphne (int[ ] a)
