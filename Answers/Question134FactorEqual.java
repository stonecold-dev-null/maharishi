/*
Two integers are defined to be factor equal, if they have the same number of factors. For example, integers 10 and 33 are factor equal because, 10 has four factors: 1, 2, 5, 10 and 33 also has four factors: 1, 3, 11, 33. On the other hand, 9 and 10 are not factor equal since 9 has only three factors: 1, 3, 9 and 10 has four factors: 1, 2, 5, 10.
Write a function named factorEqual(int n, int m) that returns 1 if n and m are factor equal and 0 otherwise. The signature of the function is
int factorEqual(int n, int m)
